# tv-show-tracker
The TV Show Tracker web app will allow users to search for TV shows, view details about their favorite series (e.g., seasons, episodes, ratings), and track their viewing progress. This project will integrate external APIs to fetch show data, support full CRUD operations for user-managed lists, and feature a modern, responsive UI.
